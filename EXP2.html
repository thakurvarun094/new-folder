<p><h3>Global Security Update</h3>
<p>
  The United States has announced the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike
  group towards the Caribbean as part of a campaign to counter drug trafficking
  and transnational criminal networks. Officials emphasized that the move is
  intended to strengthen regional security, though analysts note it also raises
  questions about Washington‚Äôs broader strategy in Venezuela.
</p>

<h3>East Africa at a Crossroads</h3>
<p>
  In Somalia, political tensions are rising ahead of the 2026 elections. The
  government‚Äôs push to change the electoral system has sparked disputes with
  opposition leaders and regional states, raising fears of renewed instability
  in a country already struggling with insurgent violence and humanitarian
  challenges.
</p>

<h3>Europe Security Case</h3>
<p>
  A British court has sentenced the ringleader of a Russia-linked arson attack
  in London to 17 years in prison. Prosecutors described the attack, which
  targeted a Ukrainian-owned business, as part of a campaign of sabotage linked
  to the Wagner mercenary group.

<center><h3>Bihar Battle Turning Bitter? INDIA Bloc Grapples With Internal Clashes, ‚ÄòFriendly Fights‚Äô on Several Seats</h3></center>

<p>As Bihar gears up for the upcoming high-stakes assembly elections, cracks within the opposition INDIA bloc are becoming increasingly visible. The alliance, formed to take on the NDA, is struggling to maintain unity as internal tussles erupt over seat-sharing, with parties gearing up for friendly fights over a dozen of seats. <br>
The alliance comprising RJD, Congress, three Left parties and former state minister Mukesh Sahani's Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has still not been able to declare how many seats were being contested by which party and confusion seemed to prevail among them with regard to the constituencies, too. <br>
Multiple constituencies, at least half-a-dozen seats, are going to witness 'friendly fights' as more than one INDIA bloc candidate has filed nomination papers. <br><br><br>
The Congress agreed to let RJD leader Rishi Mishra fight on its symbol from the Jale seat, but the domineering regional ally failed to reciprocate with a similar gesture in Lalganj where Shivani Shukla, daughter of local don-turned-politician Munna Shukla, filed her nomination papers despite Aditya Kumar Raja, fielded by the grand old party, having entered the fray. <br><br>
An RJD-Congress face-off seems on the cards in adjoining Vaishali as well, besides in Kahalgaon.
The Congress may end up fighting against CPI candidates in at least three seats ‚Äî Bachhwara, Rajapakar and Rosera. <br><br>
Although the VIP has stayed in the coalition, notwithstanding speculations that Sahani was not happy with the deal offered by the RJD, it may end up fighting against Lalu Prasad's party in Tarapur and Gaura Bauram.<br><br>
Kicking off the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) election campaign from Bihar's Samastipur on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reposed his faith in Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Addressing a rally, PM Modi declared that the NDA will get its biggest-ever mandate this year under the leadership of the JDU chief.<br><br>
"This time under the leadership of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, NDA will break all its previous records of victory. Bihar will give NDA its biggest ever mandate," said PM Modi.<br><br>
He also expressed gratitude for the large turnout and said, "I am overwhelmed by the love that you have showered. The mood that is there in Samastipur and Mithila, the only true thing is ‚Äì 'nayi raftaar se chalega Bihar, jab fir se aayegi NDA sarkar'..."
He also took a dig at Lalu Prasad Yadav's party, saying Bihar would keep "jungle raj" at bay by voting for good governance. Urging the crowd to turn on their mobile flashlights, he quipped, "When there is so much light... then do we need 'lalten' (lantern)? Bihar ko 'lalten' (RJD) aur uske saathi nahi chahiye."<br><br>

    Rohit Sharma set a massive world record during his knock of 73 in 97 balls against Australia in the second ODI during India's two-wicket defeat. Rohit completed a huge milestone while going past Viv Richards in a rare list of players. <br><br>
    Rohit Sharma etched his name in the history books by creating a new world record as he proved his critics wrong during the second ODI of the three-match series between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday (October 23) with a fighting knock of 73 in 97 balls.<br><br>
With Yashasvi Jaiswal breathing down his neck and a failure in the first ODI, the pressure on the former skipper was removed from captaincy before the tour. Despite making a scrappy start, Rohit rode the storm and ensured India were able to avoid a collapse after Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli's early departure.
Rohit Sharma Sets Massive World Record
Through the course of his innings, Rohit set a huge world record as he completed 1000 runs against Australia on Australian soil. While Rohit has 1409 runs on Australian soil overall in ODI Cricket, a total of 1071 of them have come against the home team with a stunning average of 56.36 and a strike-rate of 89.32 with four centuries and three half-centuries.<br><br>
Overall, Rohit is only the fifth player from a visiting team to score over 1000 runs against the Australian team in Australia. Meanwhile, the 39-year-old is the only eighth player to have crossed the landmark against an opponent away from home.<br><br>
In this list of eight players, Rohit has both the best average and strike-rate, breaking a record Viv Richards held for a long time.
Infact, Rohit is the only player apart from Viv Richards to average over 50 while scoring over 1000 runs against a team in the opponent's home country. <br><br>

    In this episode, my guest is David Goggins, retired Navy SEAL, highly accomplished ultramarathoner, best-selling author, and influential public speaker.

David explains how he mastered his inner dialogue to build extraordinary levels of discipline and mental and physical toughness.

He describes how confronting his early hardships, including physical and mental abuse, learning disorders, and obesity, became a practice of deep and excruciating self-reflection ‚Äî eventually allowing him to transmute those experiences into a superhuman work ethic.

This conversation is a unique window into David Goggins‚Äô process in that it focuses both on the underlying science and how David manages and directs his inner dialogue.

It‚Äôs a conversation that will inform and inspire anyone wondering how exactly to go about building discipline and confidence and reach their potential.
